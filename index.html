		<p>Hi there! I'm Van, a twenty-something-year-old Northwestern Universty Coding Bootcamp student looking for a new path in life. Previously having graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Operations Research (yes, it's as boring as it sounds), I found myself drifting from the life insurance/actuarial industry to an equally exciting career in accounting and operations at an Auntie Anne's franchise located in Skokie, Illinois.</p>

		<p>Fast forward three years and twenty pounds of free pretzels later, I decided I wanted more than broken fax machines and killing three million trees a day - so I went on a limb and started to get into coding, which I've been exposed to in the past but never received formal education on. Luckily for me, Northwestern was advertising an affordable, part-time program that I immediately boarded, and, well. Here I am, and I'm excited to start my journey!</p>
